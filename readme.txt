##### How to run this program
# Type "python3 sudoku.py" in a terminal. The program will ask for the name of
# the puzzle you want to solve. This refers to the array in sudoku.py of
# the same name. The program will then state each digit being inserted and 
# where and will update the ASCII Sudoku puzzle upon each insertion. If the 
# puzzle cannot be solved, it will let you know.

##### Testing different puzzles
# To test different puzzles, change the values in any puzzle at the top
# of sudoku.py. The puzzles currently listed in the file are example 
# easy and evil puzzles.

##### A note about speed
# This program runs very quickly, but I wanted the user to be able to watch the
# solving process. Comment out line 164 to watch it run at full speed!
